## Description

For your final project in this class you will build a complete
application on the mobile platform from scratch.  In the project you
will demonstrate that you can use what we have learned about Android
programming as well as your ability to learn independently new
features that you need.  An important part of this process is
cooperating with another member of the class to realize a shared goal.
The project you undertake has been loosely defined during the Vision &
Mockup activity, but your team of two must now define the goals,
interface, and implementation much more carefully.

You are expected to regularly make commits to the GitHub repository
set up for this project.  I will estimate your progress on the project
by looking at the activity of commits on GitHub.  I will also use
GitHub to provide feedback on your project as it develops.

Note that your code and resources must be on the main branch of the repository.  Except for early Wireframes and Navigation sketches, your app documents will be distributed as HTML/markdown on the GitHub web pages.  All submission are as a team.  Grades on the application will be shared by the members of the team.

## Due Dates

1. Goals, Wireframe, and Navigation (Due  11/8)
You should work over the next week to clearly define user goals for your app.  Working through some user personas may help you to clarify these goals.   The wireframes and navigation for your app should be reworked as a team.  The goal is refine navigation in your app on paper before you actually begin building the prototype.

2. The Design Prototype: Views, Fragments, Etc.  (Due  11/15)
Build prototypes of the activities in your app.  This is best accomplished using resources in Android Studio.  You will identify fragments and other major user interface elements.  The wireframs from Step 1 will be turned into views at this stage.  You should specify the user interface using the Model-View-Controller architecture.

3. Midway Report (Due  12/1)
This brief report will explain the current state of your app as well as any outstanding challenges.  At this point you should have a clear idea of the full extent of the finished app that you will deliver.

4. Presentation and Evaluation  (In class  12/13 and 12/15)
Your team will present its finished app and provide a working demo for evaluation.  All apps will be evaluated by the members of the class.
